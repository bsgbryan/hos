# Welcome!

Hello there and welcome to HOS, thank you for stopping by!

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/bsgbryan/hos/wiki) for info and/or if you're interested in contributing!

# Status

HOS is _very_ early in development; I haven't tested it on read hardware yet - it's been QEMU all the way baby!

If you want to check HOS out, by all means, clone the repo and `make qemu` 🤘🏻

# Credit

HOS is being built on the great work of the [RusPiRo](https://github.com/RusPiRo) and [Rust Raspberry Pi OS Tutorials](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials) projects; thank you so much!
