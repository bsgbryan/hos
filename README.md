# Welcome!

Hello there and welcome to HOS, thank you for stopping by!

# Overview

Working on HOS is the fulfillment of a dream I've had since I was 13 ☺️

HOS is an OS dedicated to running games - specifically, games built using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org).

My plan it to target ARM systems, like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com)s, as that is the smallest set of usable hardware variants to support that would still be useful to people.

# Status

HOS is _very_ early in development; I haven't tested it on read hardware yet - it's been QEMU all the way baby!

If you want to check HSO out, by all means, clone the repo and `cargo run`!
